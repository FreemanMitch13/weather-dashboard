# Weather Dashboard
By utilizing the Open Weather Map API, the user will be able to search for up to date weather data for their desired city. After searching the user will be able to see the current weather and a five day forecast for the city they searched.
## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
